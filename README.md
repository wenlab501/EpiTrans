# EpiTrans
#### R package for estimation of epidemic transmissibility in time and space

---

## Introduction
The package, EpiTrans, provides a new method for quantifying spatially adjusted (time-varying) reproductive numbers that reflects spatial heterogeneity in transmission potential among individuals. This method estimates individual-level effective reproductive numbers and a summarized indicator for population-level time-varying reproductive number.

## Package Description
It provides several functions, including (1) plotting descriptive epidemic trends in time and space; (2) estimating reproductive numbers; (3) visualizing the graphics and animations of individual-level and aggregated-level reproductive numbers.

## Installation
The package is available from Github. You can install the nightly build using the following R command:

> library(devtools)      
> install_github("wenlab501/EpiTrans")
